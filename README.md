# PdfBatch
Split PDF Files!

A CLI to split PDF files. (It's an old project and is here more for posterity rather than for development). However, it still works!

Start the program by navigating to the dist directory on your command line and type in:

    java -jar PdfBatch.jar

To use the program, choose an option and follow the instructions. When specifying an output directory, please put a slash '\' at the end of the path.
